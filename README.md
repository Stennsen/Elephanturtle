# Elephantine Equilibrium

In this game you grow some elephants to save the world (very philantrophic)!

This game was created in Bayreuth for the FrankenJam 2023 with the theme of *Give and Take*.

Dennis Streicher (coding) tried to balance the world on the back of a turtle and implemented physics to make it extra hard.
Arda Kacar (coding) is responible for making ghosts and flowers do the things they're supposed to.
Markus Kr√§utner (art & animation) provided lovely art and a wealth of knowledge & experience (no bees tho).
Selina Schmalzl (art & animation) joined in remotely to make elephants walk and turtles fly.
David Schmalzl fiddled with tiles and contributed many questions.
